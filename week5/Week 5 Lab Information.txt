My apologies Ken:

It's been a bit of a tough past three weeks - due to circumstances beyond my control, I did not have the time 
(and timing) that I needed this week to do this lab. Between my time wearing razor thin and continuing to 
overturn stones of weak areas that I need practice with, I was only able to get so far. I don't like to make 
excuses, and I fully understand the policy of getting a zero for turning in late work, so I am submitting 
what I do have and will work hard to get back on track this coming week. If I can't, I'll reach out further when 
appropriate to figure out a plan, but for now I will focus on what went wrong so I can try to course-correct
(no pun intended).
